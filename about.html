                <p>As a passionate and detail-oriented software developer, I thrive on creating innovative solutions and engaging user experiences through a diverse set of technical skills. My background includes proficiency in languages such as Java, JavaScript, Typescript, and Python, along with experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. I have hands-on experience with frameworks and tools including React, Bootstrap, Node.js, and Spring Boot, and I have experience with testing and deployment practices with Docker and JUnit.</p>
                <p>In addition to my technical capabilities, my role as a Product Manager at ASSMANN WSW has honed my project management skills, enabling me to effectively coordinate tasks, analyze data, and communicate technical information to stakeholders. My academic background in Software Development from Grand Canyon University, combined with my experience as a student-athlete, has instilled in me a strong work ethic, a team-oriented mindset, and a drive for continuous learning.</p>
                <p>Outside of studying and work I enjoy spending time with family and friends. Lately I have been getting into pickleball, and have enjoyed meeting new people through pickleball.</p>
